# 🧪 ChemAR - Augmented Reality for STEM Education

**ChemAR** is an innovative **Augmented Reality (AR)** mobile application built in Unity.  
Its goal is to bridge the gap between theory and practice in STEM subjects, helping students visualize and interact with complex concepts through immersive AR experiences.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Many schools, especially in Zimbabwe and other developing regions, lack the resources for extensive experiments and interactive teaching. **ChemAR** solves this by providing an affordable, interactive, and student-centric learning experience — giving learners the opportunity to grasp abstract concepts through 3D models and virtual experiments.
